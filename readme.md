# `acier trade bot`
`acier trade bot` is a **discontinued** python-based [roblox](https://roblox.com) trade bot. this bot automatically trades your roblox collectible/limited items for other items, requesting a small profit in return. this bot made several of my 200 buyers a few thousand dollars. 
this has definitely been one of my longest maintained programs, with it being for sale for 8+ months. unfortunately, however, i was forced to discontinue this program in early august 2022 as roblox implemented a **100 trade daily limit**.
